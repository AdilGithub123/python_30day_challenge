## Day 5 — Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples

### Project 1 — Student Score Analyzer
A small analytics tool that:
- Takes a list of students and scores
- Computes average, highest, and lowest
- Shows which students scored above average
- Demonstrates dict usage, aggregation, and list comprehensions

### Project 2 — Unique Word Extractor
A text-processing script that:
- Normalizes text
- Removes basic punctuation
- Extracts all unique words using a set
- Outputs count and alphabetical ordering of the unique words

### Project 3 — Coordinate System (Tuple-Based)
A geometry utility that:
- Collects (x, y) coordinates as tuples
- Calculates distance from origin using `sqrt(x² + y²)`
- Determines which point is closest/farthest
- Trains tuple handling, iteration, and `max/min` with custom keys
