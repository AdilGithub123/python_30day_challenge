# Python 30-Day Foundations Challenge

A structured, incremental journey through the fundamentals of Python.  
Each day introduces new core concepts through three small, focused projects.

This repo documents all completed days and their projects.

---

## **Day 1 — Variables, Input, Output**
### Project 1 — Area of a Rectangle  
Basic arithmetic with user input.

### Project 2 — Temperature Converter  
Celsius/Fahrenheit converter using formulas.

### Project 3 — Tip Calculator  
Simple percentage math and formatted output.

---

## **Day 2 — Conditionals**
### Project 1 — Age Group Classifier  
Classifies user age into categories with validation.

### Project 2 — Password Strength Checker  
Basic alpha/digit validation with `any()`.

### Project 3 — Simple Calculator  
Supports +, -, \*, / with error handling and exit conditions.

---

## **Day 3 — Loops**
### Project 1 — Sum of Even Numbers  
List building via loops and conditional aggregation.

### Project 2 — Shopping List Manager  
A menu-driven loop that adds/removes/displays items until exit.

### Project 3 — Number Guessing Game  
Random number guessing with hints and attempt counting.

---

## **Day 4 — Strings**
### Project 1 — Name Normalizer  
Strips spaces, fixes casing, and rebuilds clean names.

### Project 2 — Email Validator  
Very lightweight sanity-check rules using string methods.

### Project 3 — Word Frequency Counter  
Lowercases, removes punctuation, splits, and counts using a dictionary.

---

## **Day 5 — Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples**
### Project 1 — Student Score Analyzer  
Stores name/score pairs, finds high/low, computes average, and reports above-average students.

### Project 2 — Unique Word Extractor  
Extracts distinct normalized words via a set and outputs them alphabetically.

### Project 3 — Tuple-Based Coordinate System  
Collects (x, y) pairs, computes distances, and finds closest/farthest points.

More days will be added as the challenge continues.
